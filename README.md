This utilized a Pandas dataframe to structure a kaggle student exam performance dataset with columns for each data point. Valuable insights were derived using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize, analyze, and clean the dataset. A Scikit-Learn linear regression model was developed to predict student exam performance with a 98.8% accuracy. 

Using the created Scikit Learn linear regression model and wrapped it to be used in API requests with Pickle. A Flask Python API handled HTTP POST requests containing information needed to make a prediction on student performance using the model captured by pickle. The React.js front end allows users to enter data values to get a dynamic response from the model to understand what the predicting exam performance index is from 0 to 100 marks.
