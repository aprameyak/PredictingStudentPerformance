This utilized a Pandas dataframe to structure a kaggle student exam performance dataset with columns for each data point. Valuable insights were derived using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize, analyze, and clean the dataset. A Scikit-Learn linear regression model was developed to predict student exam performance with a 98.8% accuracy.
